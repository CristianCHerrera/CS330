1. How do I approach writing software?
A design skill that this project reinforced was ensuring the program was modular. Time was taken to learn the OpenGL program and how to create a scene that can be easily modified by a future developer.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
As I worked on the milestones leading up to the final 3D scene, because I knew what the end result was meant to look like and had pieces of the program that I had to complete at specific times. I more closely used the waterfall methodology.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Learning a new technology such as OpenGL was a fun and occasionally stressful endeavor, but I learned new skills and have grown more confident in my ability to learn technologies and spend time understanding how it works.
